# Budi Setiawan – Professional Portfolio

**AI • Machine Learning • Computer Vision • Full-Stack Web • Automation • PLC • TestStand • LabVIEW**

This repository hosts the source and deployment files for my professional portfolio website, developed using JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and deployed via GitHub Pages. It showcases a curated collection of my work across multiple technology domains, highlighting both breadth and depth of experience.

## 🎯 What You’ll Find

The website is structured to present several project categories, reflecting my multi-disciplinary engagement with software, hardware, and automation domains:

* **AI / Machine Learning Projects** – Algorithms, models and systems I’ve built or applied in real-world contexts.
* **Computer Vision Projects** – Vision-based solutions, image processing, object detection/tracking, etc.
* **ASP.NET [C#] Projects** – Web applications or backend systems developed in C# using the ASP.NET framework.
* **LabVIEW Projects** – Test and measurement automation solutions implemented with NI LabVIEW.
* **TestStand Projects** – Automated test frameworks built using National Instruments TestStand.
* **Qt Projects** – Applications or GUIs developed using the Qt framework (C++ or PyQt).
* **Full-Stack Web + AI/ML** – End-to-end web solutions that integrate frontend, backend, and AI/ML components.
* **C# Projects** – Standalone applications or services written in C#.
* **VB.NET Projects** – Legacy or modern prototyping work using VB .NET.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript — crafting a responsive, performant static site.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages — simple, reliable deployment of static assets.
* **Source Control:** Git & GitHub — version control for website and individual project repositories.
* **Project Link-outs:** Each category links to individual project repositories or demos, allowing deeper dive into code, architecture, results.

## 🔍 Why This Portfolio Matters

In today’s technology landscape, meaningful problem-solving frequently involves bridging multiple domains. My portfolio demonstrates how I’ve:

* stitched together **software development**, **data science**, and **automation** to deliver working systems;
* moved beyond theory by publishing fully functional projects and code;
* adapted across platforms and languages — from web stacks to embedded test systems;
* built for real-world contexts — not just toy examples, but systems you can explore and reuse.

Whether you're looking for a collaborator, examining technical depth, or assessing tool fluency, this portfolio gives visibility into my workflow, skill-set, and project thinking.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone or fork** this repository to inspect the website source.
2. Browse each project category folder, where you’ll find:

   * Read-me files with project descriptions, architecture diagrams, outcomes
   * Code, data, or binaries (as permitted) for demonstration
3. For deployment: since this is a GitHub Pages site, navigate to **Settings → Pages** (if you fork) and point to the correct branch/folder.
4. Use the site as a **template** or **starting point** if you plan to build your own multi-tech portfolio.
